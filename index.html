        <p>This <strong class = "bright"> very short </strong> survey will ask you to <strong> type your information into various text input fields </strong> in order to evaluate the character frequencies that are typical of online form fields.</p>

        </span>

        <ul>

        <li> One field will be presented at a time. </li>
        <li> Pressing the <strong class = "dark"> Enter key </strong> will advance to the next field. </li>
        <li> Please <em class = "bright"><strong> press Enter without typing anything into the field </strong></em> if you wish to skip a field. <strong class = "dark">This is very important</strong>, as even a space will be registered as a character in our system. </li>
        <li> You may skip as few or as many times as you wish! </li>

        <strong>No part of your data will be stored, even temporarily!</strong> </span> <br/>
        Our system calculates character frequency on the client-side, meaning that anything you type in (for example "Alan") will immediately be converted into completely anonymized data (i.e. "A = 2 instances, L = 1 instance, N = 1 instance").</p>

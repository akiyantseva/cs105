            <p class = "large-text"> As you may or may not have guessed, this survey was not actually not about character frequency... </p> <br/>


            <p> It was about people's <strong> willingness to provide information </strong> of various levels of sensitivity either with or without notification of their peers' decisions. There were three different conditions in this study: <em> with </em> information about others' decisions and <em> without </em> this information, and with time pressure.Those in the <em> with </em> condition were given a prompt for each field informing them that "[X] other people have answered this". In reality, these amounts were entirely fictitious.</p>

            <p class = "large-text dark centered"> However, it is true that <strong> no actual data has been stored </strong>: only a "true" or "false" value has been recorded for each field.</p> <br/>

            <p class ="tiny-text">This is what your data looks like to us: <br/>

            <span id ="formdata"></span> <br/>

            This is all that will be stored in our system. If you would still like to erase this (this would make us very sad! D:), you may do so:
            <input id = "erase" type="submit" value="Erase"/>

            </p>

            <p> If you would like to be notified of the results of this study, please enter your e-mail (this time it will actually be recorded!):

            <input type="email" pattern="[^ @]*@[^ @]*" value=""> <input id = "submit-email" type="submit" value="Submit"/>
